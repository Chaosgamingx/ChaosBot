## Data collection

> ChaosBot does not, and will not, sell or collect personal data. If you have any concerns, please contact me and I can help you out.

## Self hosting

> ChaosBot, while can be self hosted, has many bugs in it that can cause the bot to crash by a misuse of commands. You may self host ChaosBot if you wish or use the official chaosbot for best usage.
